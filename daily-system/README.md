# CTX Daily System - Practical Day-to-Day Context Tracking

> **"Help me Obi Wan, you're my only hope"** - Mission accomplished! 🎉

This is the **practical daily-use context tracking system** built from all the documentation and examples in the ctx-tools project. Instead of theoretical guides, this provides **real tools you can use every day**.

## 🎯 What This Solves

The ctx-tools documentation had excellent patterns and examples, but lacked a **practical daily system**. This bridges that gap by providing:

- **Ready-to-use daily workflow manager**
- **Specialized workflow templates** (payment hotfixes, incident response)
- **Team collaboration patterns**
- **Memory integration** for knowledge retention
- **One-command setup** and configuration

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install the daily system
cd ~/projects/active/ctx-tools/daily-system
./setup-daily-system.sh

# 2. Activate (restart terminal or run this)
source ~/.bashrc

# 3. Start using it immediately
ctx-daily start
ctx-daily focus "Complete payment API integration"
ctx-daily work PAYMENT-5320 "Refund service implementation"
```

## 📁 What We Built

## 🔧 Daily Workflow Commands

### Core Daily Flow
```bash
ctx-daily start                    # Begin daily tracking
ctx-daily focus "main priority"    # Set today's focus
ctx-daily work TASK-123 "desc"     # Start working on task
ctx-daily progress "what you did"  # Track progress
ctx-daily blocked "what's blocking" # Handle blockers
ctx-daily handoff review           # Ready for team handoff
ctx-daily end                      # End day with summary
```

### Quick Aliases (auto-installed)
```bash
ctx-today          # Start day and show status
ctx-done           # End day with summary
ctx-focus "task"   # Set daily focus
ctx-quick          # List contexts
ctx-payment-hotfix # Payment hotfix workflow
ctx-incident       # Incident response workflow
```

## 🛠️ Specialized Workflows

### Payment Hotfix (Based on Your CyberSource Expertise)
```bash
ctx-payment-hotfix PAYMENT-5320 "Fix CyberSource Level 3 validation"
```

Creates structured context with:
- ✅ Technical setup checklist
- ✅ CyberSource testing framework (Auth ID, Token ID validation)
- ✅ Development checkpoints
- ✅ Team handoff protocols

### Incident Response
```bash
ctx-incident INC-2025-001 P1 "Payment API returning 500 errors"
```

Creates incident context with:
- ✅ Severity-based response times
- ✅ Investigation checklist
- ✅ System health checks
- ✅ Stakeholder notification tracking

## 🧠 Memory Integration

The system preserves knowledge for future use:

```bash
# Extract patterns from completed work
python3 memory-integration.py sync

# Get suggestions based on similar contexts
python3 memory-integration.py suggest

# Extract knowledge from current context
python3 memory-integration.py extract
```

## 🤝 Team Collaboration Features

### Context Sharing
- **Export/Import**: Share contexts between team members
- **Standardized handoffs**: Clear protocols for QA, deployment, etc.
- **Team visibility**: See what everyone is working on

### Real Examples from Your Work
The payment hotfix workflow incorporates patterns from your `cybersource-testing-matrix`:
- Auth ID and Token ID validation
- card_type_cd field handling
- Zero dollar filtering tests
- Database verification queries
- Independent variables matrix approach

## ⚙️ Configuration

Customize `~/.ctx-daily-config`:
```bash
# Team settings
TEAM_NAME="development-team"
PROJECT_PREFIX="PROJ"

# Work schedule
WORK_HOURS="09:00-17:00"
REVIEW_TIME="17:00"

# Integration URLs
JIRA_BASE_URL="https://yourcompany.atlassian.net"
GITHUB_ORG="your-org"
```

## 📊 Daily Usage Examples

### Typical Development Day
```bash
# Morning
ctx-daily start
ctx-daily focus "Complete PAYMENT-5465 zero dollar filtering fix"

# Start work
ctx-daily work PAYMENT-5465 "CyberSource zero dollar filtering"
ctx-daily progress "Created feature branch, started implementation"
ctx-daily progress "Added zero dollar validation logic"

# Hit a blocker
ctx-daily blocked "Need CyberSource test credentials from DevOps"

# Resume after blocker resolved
ctx-daily unblock "Received test credentials, continuing implementation"
ctx-daily progress "Completed implementation, writing tests"

# Ready for review
ctx-daily handoff review "PR #1234 ready, 18 tests passing, 95% coverage"

# End of day
ctx-daily end
```

### Incident Response
```bash
# Incident detected
ctx-incident INC-2025-001 P1 "Payment API 500 errors"
ctx-daily progress "Database healthy, payment gateway degraded"
ctx-daily progress "Enabled circuit breaker, errors decreasing"
ctx-daily unblock "Payment gateway provider resolved database failover"
```

## 🎉 Success Metrics

You now have:

✅ **Practical daily system** (not just documentation)  
✅ **One-command setup** for immediate use  
✅ **Specialized workflows** for your payment work  
✅ **Team collaboration** patterns  
✅ **Memory integration** for knowledge building  
✅ **Real examples** based on your successful practices  

## 📚 Integration with Existing Docs

This system **implements** the patterns from:
- `docs/AGENTIC_INTEGRATION.md` - Agent workflow patterns
- `docs/agent-prompts/` - Role-specific prompts  
- `examples/sprint_workflow.py` - Lifecycle management
- `docs/cursor_integration.md` - IDE integration

But makes them **immediately usable** rather than just examples.

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Use it daily** - The best way to improve it
2. **Customize workflows** - Add your own templates
3. **Share with team** - Export/import contexts
4. **Integrate with tools** - Add JIRA/GitHub automation
5. **Build memory** - Let knowledge accumulate over time

**Mission Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

From theoretical documentation to practical daily-use system. The force is strong with this one! 🌟
